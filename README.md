# To-Do List Application

This is a simple to-do list web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows you to create, manage, and organize your tasks efficiently.

## Features

1. **Add Tasks**: You can add new tasks by typing the task description in the input field and clicking the "Add" button. The tasks are added to the list below.

2. **Task Completion**: Each task can be marked as completed by checking the associated checkbox. Completed tasks are displayed with a strikethrough, making it easy to identify completed items.

3. **Delete Tasks**: To remove a task, click the "Delete" button next to the task. The task will be permanently removed from the list.

4. **Drag and Drop**: You can reorder tasks by dragging and dropping them. This feature allows you to prioritize your tasks according to your preference.

5. **Task Count**: The application provides a count of the remaining open tasks at the top, allowing you to keep track of your tasks easily.

6. **Filtering**: You can filter tasks by choosing from three options in the dropdown menu: "All," "Active," and "Completed." This feature helps you focus on the tasks you want to see.

7. **Clear Completed Tasks**: A "Clear Completed" button is provided to remove all completed tasks from the list, helping you keep your to-do list clutter-free.
